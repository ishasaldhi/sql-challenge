# sql-challenge

## Background
In this project, I used SQL in PostgreSQL to research a Pewlett Hackard's employee database using 6 CSV files. Using the company's data, I created an ERD, table schemas, and analyzed the records of people who were employed at the company during the 1980s and 1990s.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
I used extracted and transformed the crowdfunding data using Python, Pandas, and dictionaries and list comprehensions to create 4 CSV files. Then, I loaded these files into a Postgres database in order to create an entity relationship diagram and table schema for the data.

## Features 
* Data modeling the contents of 6 CSV files to create an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
* Using PostgreSQL in order to create a datebase reflecting the ERD.
* Importing the CSV files into PostgreSQL to complete the table scehemas.
* Analyzing the data in the 6 tables to answer questions regarding Pewlett Hackard's employees.

## Installation
1. Clone reposittory
2. Use Quick Database Diagrams to create an ERD
3. Set up PostgreSQL and create database called employees_db

## Built with
